/* By Kevin (Kevli) Li (Class of 2016)
 * 
 * This header file contains a quick and dirty implementation of the Halfedge
 * data structure for the purpose of processing meshes WITHOUT boundary.
 *
 * Every part of the implementation is defined loosely as structs or standalone
 * functions, which makes this header file easy to use and portable. Of course,
 * this also means that this implementation is not as robust or has as many
 * safe-checks as professional software.
 *
 * This halfedge implementation was meant to be USED, not edited. Hence, there
 * are only comments here detailing how to use the halfedge, but none on the
 * actual code that implements the data structure.
 *
 * The main function of interest in this header file is:
 *
 *     build_HE(Mesh_Data *mesh,
 *              std::vector<HEV*> *hevs,
 *              std::vector<HEF*> *hefs);
 * 
 * This function constructs the halfedge data structure and takes in three
 * arguments:
 *
 *     Mesh_Data *mesh is a reference to a Mesh_Data struct that contains
 *      std::vector lists of our vertices and faces. See the struct.h file
 *      to see the code for the Mesh_Data struct. It should be fairly straight-
 *      forward to figure out how to use it based on the code, since the structs
 *      are all very simple. One thing to note is that the first element pushed
 *      onto the vertices vector should be a NULL; this is just filler since
 *      .obj files 1-index vertices.
 *
 *     std::vector<HEV*> *hevs is just a new, empty vector of HEV structs.
 *      This vector is meant to be initialized and populated by our build_HE
 *      function. The idea is for hevs to be a list of our "halfedge vertices",
 *      which are vertex structs that also each contain a pointer to a halfedge.
 *      Note that this list is also 1-indexed, so the first element is NULL.
 *
 *     std::vector<HEF*> *hefs is similar to hevs in that it should just be
 *      a new, empty vector of HEF structs. The vector will be initialized
 *      and populated by our build_HE function with "halfedge faces", which are
 *      face structs that each contain a pointer to a halfedge. These face structs
 *      are only meant for accessing halfedges; they don't actually contain
 *      the indices of the vertices that make up the face as we can see in
 *      the code below. They don't need to anyway, since we can find all
 *      the vertices in the face by traversing through the halfedges.
 *
 * The following is a code snippet of how we might build a halfedge using
 * the build_HE function:
 *
 *     Mesh_Data *mesh_data = new Mesh_Data;
 *     parse_OBJ(mesh_data, filename); // your parsing function
 *
 *     // at this point, mesh_data contains our vertices and faces for the mesh
 *
 *     std::vector<HEV*> *hevs = new std::vector<HEV*>();
 *     std::vector<HEF*> *hefs = new std::vector<HEF*>();
 *
 *     build_HE(mesh_data, hevs, hefs);
 *     // do things with hevs and hefs
 *
 * If the build is successful, then hevs and hefs should contain lists of
 * vertex and face structs that also have pointer data to halfedges.
 *
 * Now, to use our hevs and hefs lists for applications like computing
 * the area-weighted vertex normal, we can write code like the following:
 *
 * Vec3f calc_vertex_normal(HEV *vertex)
   {
       Vec3f normal;
       normal.x = 0;
       normal.y = 0;
       normal.z = 0;

       HE* he = vertex->out; // get outgoing halfedge from given vertex

       do
       {
           // compute the normal of the plane of the face
           Vec3f face_normal = calc_normal(he->face);
           // compute the area of the triangular face
           double face_area = calc_area(he->face);

           // accummulate onto our normal vector
           normal.x += face_normal.x * face_area;
           normal.y += face_normal.y * face_area;
           normal.z += face_normal.z * face_area;

           // gives us the halfedge to the next adjacent vertex
           he = he->flip->next;
    }
    while(he != vertex->out);
 *
 * The code above follows the loop structure that we explain in the lecture notes.
 * Refer there for details of why this loop traverses the neighborhood region
 * of the given vertex correctly. We can imagine writing a similar loop to help
 * us compute parts of the discrete Laplacian, since it is defined to be a sum
 * over vertices adjacent to the current vertex of interest.
 *
 * When we're done using our halfedge, we should call the delete_HE() function,
 * which takes in the vector of hevs and hefs built by build_HE. This delete function
 * frees all the memory that we set aside for our halfedge.
 *
 * Realize that the hevs and hefs vectors are meant to exist IN ADDITION to your regular
 * list of vertices and faces (i.e. the ones you passed into the build_HE function). The
 * idea is to mainly access the hevs and hefs vectors for halfedge-related computations
 * and still use the regular list of vertices and faces for the usual tasks like drawing
 * the mesh in OpenGL.
 *
 * If you have any questions or difficulties working with this code, don't
 * be afraid to send me an email at kevli@caltech.edu.
